After installing HivePal, open up its Data directory
and edit ROMs.def with notepad. Add the following onto a new line

474D2030303030313132322D3030|goldenaxe2.Pal

Then save and close.
Make sure goldeaxe2.Pal is placed inside the Data folder too.
Then open your Golden Axe II (World).bin from HivePal.

Do not edit any addresses beginning with TEST.
They are of unknown purpose and may cause problems if edited.
